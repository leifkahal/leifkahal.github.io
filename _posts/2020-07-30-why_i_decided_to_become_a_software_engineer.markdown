Solving issues and efficiency...that sums it up best.

Technology has always been an active part of my life. My step father worked for IBM, so i had access to computers at an early age and at a time when almost nobody had a computer.

In 2004 I was hired to manage a digital photolab and decided to build a website where customers could order digital prints. Kiosks were new and expensive, so I built our own kiosks with PCs and touch screen panels that you could attach to a monitor. That is when i found something that i was truly passionate about.

Over the years that followed, I taght myself to write HTML, CSS, and eventually PHP. At this point it was more like a hobby. But eventually, I was hired to build a website...then another...and then a job as an in-house "web guy" at a music venue. I learned JavaScript, how to work with API's, and WordPress while on this job.This lasted for six years until the business closed it's doors...now i had to find a job elsewhere. 

The job search made it clear that the experience I gained over the past six years was useless as it pertained to getting hired as a web developer. 

So, with a family to feed, i got my CDL and started a truck driving career. It pays well, but it is not what I love.

Flatiron has given me the opportunity to become what I love and to get HIRED doing what I love.
